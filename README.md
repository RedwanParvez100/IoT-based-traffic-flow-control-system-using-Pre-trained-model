# IoT-based-traffic-flow-control-system-using-Pre-trained-model

## 🚦 Overview
This project uses IoT technology and pre-trained machine learning models to build a smart traffic control system. It automatically manages traffic flow using input images—no need for human intervention.

## Features

- Automated traffic control using image input
- Uses pre-trained ML models with OpenCV
- Real-time system activation with Raspberry Pi
- Helps reduce traffic congestion

## Components Used

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B  
- Tower Pro MG90S Micro Servo  
- OLED Display  
- Male to Female Jumper Wires

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

When an image is provided, the system activates and uses OpenCV with a pre-trained model to analyze traffic conditions. Based on the analysis, it controls components like servo motor and displays messages on an OLED screen.
