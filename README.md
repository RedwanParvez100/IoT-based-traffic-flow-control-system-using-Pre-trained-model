# IoT-based-traffic-flow-control-system-using-Pre-trained-model

## ðŸš¦ Overview
This project uses IoT technology and pre-trained machine learning models to build a smart traffic control system. It automatically manages traffic flow using input imagesâ€”no need for human intervention.

## Features

- Automated traffic control using image input
- Uses pre-trained ML models with OpenCV
- Real-time system activation with Raspberry Pi
- Helps reduce traffic congestion
